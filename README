This is a test project.
Goals:
- setup this git account - DONE
- learn & test - STARTED, enough is ready
- write the first R program to handle the stuff - Took graph & code from http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/2011/02/22/september-2011-arctic-sea-ice-extent-forecast/
- setup the arctic thingie - YUP, first results are nice...

Code is edited here, updated on the server (php calls shell script to update the local git there, launch the R script and create ze graph). 
All done in 3 hours :-)
